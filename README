👋 Hey there, I'm Pieter De Villiers, your friendly neighborhood software craftsman and code aficionado. 🚀

💼 By day, I'm a Software Engineer and Programmer, specializing in the Microsoft stack with a focus on F#, C#, SQL, and DevOps. I'm the magician behind the scenes, conjuring elegant code solutions that make things work seamlessly.

🎨 My coding palette includes not just Microsoft languages but also a varied collection - from Python to mobile wizardry with Flutter and web mastery with Blazor, React, and JavaScript. I'm like a polyglot of the programming world.

🔧 I'm your go-to for DevOps sorcery, C# wizardry, and crafting black boxes (not the mysterious kind). I've delved deep into insurance development, creating rating engines, and making things work like a well-oiled machine.

👾 When I'm not coding, you might find me in the Linux wilderness or conquering the digital realms in PC gaming. I have a soft spot for cyber security, and I promise I only wear the white hat - Penetration testing and hacking are my thing (the ethical kind, of course). 👁️🔐

🛠️ I live by the motto: "With enough time and money, I can build or hack anything." Or, as they say, "Of all the things I lost, I lost my mind the most." 💡

🌐 Explore my world of code and creativity here. Let's build something great together!
